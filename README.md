# Hey, I'm Fonseca 👋
**Product Designer (UX/UI) & Brand Builder** focused on **Web3, fintech, and complex systems** — turning messy flows into clear, shippable products.

I work end-to-end: **discovery → UX strategy → interaction/UI → design systems → handoff → launch**.  
On the side, I build **visual identities, key visuals, and marketing assets** that help products feel consistent and premium.

---

## What I do
- **Product Design:** journeys, IA, wireframes, prototypes, usability, UX writing
- **Interaction Craft:** flows, micro-interactions, empty states, edge cases
- **Design Systems:** components, tokens, guidelines, scalability
- **Brand & Visual:** identity, key visuals, social assets, narrative & positioning
- **Web3 / DeFi:** on-chain apps, prediction markets, wallets, dashboards, token flows

---

## Current focus
- Designing **Web3-native experiences** that feel simple to people who don’t speak crypto
- Building **high-trust UI** for finance-like products (stablecoins, payments, compliance-aware UX)
- Improving **shipping velocity** with better systems, documentation, and tighter handoff

---

## Highlights
- 🏆 Hackathon winner (ETHSamba) + champion at BlockchainRio  
- 🌍 International experience (Portugal + Argentina)  
- 🧩 Worked across products and brands — from **health/insurance platforms** to **Web3 launches**  
- 🚀 Strong at balancing **quality vs. time-to-market** (launching with feedback loops)

---

## Selected work (case studies)
- **Hedgehog Protocol** — On-chain prediction market (UX + branding + launch assets)
- **Picnic** — Company Key Visual (grid, color system, branding for social + events)
- **Petrobras Saúde / Seguros Unimed** — Platform redesigns focused on clarity and speed
